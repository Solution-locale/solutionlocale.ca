# Contributing

New issues and PRs are welcomed, but:

- If you want to tackle one of the already opened issue or item on the projet's todo list, please mention it in comment. We're getting help from multiple sources and we want to avoid multiple people working on the same thing!

- We ask the following guidelines are respected;

    the PR adds a compelling new feature
    OR addresses a known / open issue
    OR improves reliability / robustness
    don't update version num - will be incremented when the PR is merged
